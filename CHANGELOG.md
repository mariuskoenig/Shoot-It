## [1.21.2+pottsblitz.20261005] - 2026-10-05

### Added
- Add a visible Download link inside image previews on iPhone and iPad, including iPadOS desktop mode. It opens the original inline for native saving and respects public selection download permissions.
- Keep result file details available in the image actions menu and list view.

### Fixed
- Use compact responsive thumbnail grids and masonry columns; bound photo height while containing the complete frame, including public project overview thumbnails.
- Open public overview thumbnails in the preview instead of only scrolling to the moodboard.
- Delay browser-only direct-download detection until mount to avoid mismatched server/client markup in public selections.
- Reuse an existing valid session on the home and login pages and redirect signed-in users to their dashboard or a safe local return path; keep the existing cookie/session policy.
- Hide internal build metadata in the visible footer and workspace version; retain the complete internal identifier for support and rollback.
- Open the image preview directly when clicking result thumbnails in all gallery layouts.
- Follow the currently displayed image when opening its original after lightbox navigation; continue reusing existing upload previews without additional derivatives.

## [1.21.1+pottsblitz.20261004] - 2026-10-04

### Fixed
- Preserve complete portrait and landscape images in selection, result and moodboard galleries, including public views and inspector previews; remove cropping hover zoom.
- Reuse the single existing proportional WebP preview (maximum 2560 px) in thumbnails, inspectors and lightboxes, without additional derivatives or rewriting existing files.
- Preserve EXIF orientation for future uploads and create the same canonical preview during local-media import.
- Keep original files for downloads and video playback; load only the current lightbox image.
- Avoid overlapping modal focus managers when opening a lightbox from an image menu; restore gallery accessibility after closing.

## [1.21.0+pottsblitz.20261004] - 2026-10-04

### Changed
- Adopt upstream 1.21.0 while retaining the Atelier POTTsblitz customizations.
- Keep separate public selection/results pages, result-file counts, the dashboard storage overview and all accessible projects.
- Retain per-image deletion and project deletion from dashboard cards, including aborting database deletion when filesystem cleanup fails.
- Retain the 100 MiB selection upload limit and prevent deletion controls on public results.
- Patch Next.js to 16.3.8, the Prisma auth adapter to 2.11.3, sharp to 0.35.5 and Nano ID within its existing major version after dependency security review. Prisma remains 6.19.2.
- Align reported application versions with the package version; use the supported webpack build within the server memory limit.
- Refresh compatible transitive brace-expansion and browser mapping dependencies.
- Dashboard project delete controls are shown only for project owners.
- Deployment preserves the existing PostgreSQL 18 parent mount explicitly through POSTGRES_VOLUME_TARGET; the custom image is pinned and automatic updates remain disabled.

## [1.21.0] - 2026-10-01

### Added
- Project-specific participant photo uploads in the person details, including validation and editor permissions; linked profile photos retain priority.
- Participant photos in cards, project previews and public participant lists. Uses existing image storage without a schema migration.

## [1.20.0] - 2026-10-01

### Added
- Per-user recently opened projects based on actual visits, including removal of projects whose access was revoked.
- Admin controls to upload or reset images for the landing, login and signup pages.
- Project cover selection from linked moodboards, image selections and results; covers retain an independent image copy.
- Star, color and unrated filters for public image selections, including filtered previews and downloads.
- Additive migration for project visits and site image settings; existing project data and default images are preserved.

## [1.19.0] - 2026-10-01

### Added
- Project cover editing, accessible header and profile menus, generated photography assets, and a password visibility toggle.
- Offline design checks for German and English, public gallery controls, participant cards, and callsheet timestamp rendering.

### Changed
- Brought project, selection, results, moodboard, participant, contract, callsheet, appointment, application, profile, authentication and public screens closer to the approved designs.
- Reworked image folders, breadcrumbs, grid/list views, detail panels and selection actions; improved desktop spacing and mobile navigation.

### Fixed
- Preserved image IDs when dragging selections between folders and kept public gallery controls read-only.
- Corrected callsheet save fields and schedule timestamps, retained schedule notes, and added visible save errors.
- Fixed mobile filter overflow, drawer focus handling and missing German/English interface text.

## [1.18.2] - 2026-09-30

### Fixed
- Gallery thumbnails load lazily and decode asynchronously; videos no longer preload metadata. Public moodboards use generated thumbnails while the lightbox retains full-resolution media (#22).

### Changed
- Updated Next.js to 16.2.3 and Nodemailer to 8.0.5 (#18, #21).
- Updated Auth.js to 5.0.0-beta.32 for Nodemailer 8 compatibility so clean installs and Docker builds continue to work without peer-dependency bypasses.
- Updated transitive dependencies: minimatch, flatted, picomatch, brace-expansion, defu, lodash, fast-xml-parser and the AWS SES SDK (#9, #12, #14, #16, #17, #19, #20).

## [1.18.1] - 2026-09-30

### Removed
- Retired the separate Linux host/systemd updater, installer, management commands and their dedicated tests. The Docker updater remains the automatic-update path on Linux and QNAP.
- Obsolete manual 1.11/1.12 transition instructions; current guidance uses app-start migration or the Docker updater. Historical migration SQL and recovery support remain available.

### Changed
- Consolidated update documentation and retained shared release validation, safe downloads, journal helpers and manual Compose coverage for the Docker updater. Existing host installations have explicit timer-retirement instructions; saved backups and journals are not removed.

## [1.18.0] - 2026-09-30

### Changed
- Extended the workspace redesign across profile, project, participant, contract, callsheet, selection, results, moodboard, appointment and public views.
- Kept the desktop navigation and content side by side while retaining the single-column mobile layout.

## [1.17.0] - 2026-09-30

### Added
- The first successful registration becomes the instance owner and administrator, including Google OAuth registrations. Concurrent first signups elect exactly one owner.
- Existing installations promote their oldest account through a data-preserving migration. Other admin grants and project ownership remain unchanged.
- Owner label in the admin dashboard and protection against revoking the owner's admin access with the administration command.

## [1.16.0] - 2026-09-30

### Added
- Automatic legacy migration at app startup: the stock 1.8.x–1.11.x schema is backed up in the persistent uploads volume, bridged and baselined before the web server starts. Fresh and already migrated databases apply normal migrations.
- Shared database migration lock, durable interruption marker, bundled PostgreSQL backup tools and blocked HTTP access to migration backups. Container tests cover backup restore, repeated startup, backup failure and schema drift.
- `migrate` command in the updater container: database-only backup and migration, without upload archiving or app image replacement. The old app remains stopped with restart disabled after success.
- Additive bridge for stock 1.8.x/1.9.x schemas before the 1.11 baseline and current migrations; repeated runs preserve users, projects and existing registration settings.
- Migration-only integration coverage, explicit release capability/minimum version, and Container Station instructions. Failed/interrupted migrations remain blocked for recovery.

## [1.15.0] - 2026-09-30

### Added
- Standalone updater image and QNAP Container Station template: detects installed versions, checks actual Docker storage, backs up the database/uploads, and replaces only the application container. No host Python, systemd, Compose CLI, checkout or `.env` path required.
- Explicit, repeatable legacy upgrade from the 1.10 schema through the additive 1.11 changes, validated baseline and current migrations in one maintenance run.
- One-time, check and scheduled modes; persistent recovery journal, daemon-wide update lock, compatible image rollback and blocked retries after interrupted migrations.
- Disposable container integration tests for legacy PostgreSQL 18 mounts, backup restore, preserved container settings, failed migrations and rollback; release CI publishes the updater image only to `latest` after verification.

### Changed
- NAS documentation uses the container workflow; existing manual Compose and opt-in Linux host updater remain available.

## [1.14.0] - 2026-09-30

### Added
- A consistent studio workspace with dark project navigation, compact top bar, responsive mobile drawer and image-led project cards.
- Dedicated public landing, authentication and project showcase layouts in the new Shoot-It visual system.

### Changed
- Redesigned dashboard, project overview, moodboard entry, profile, admin and project modules around the new cobalt, graphite and cool-gray interface.
- Standardized cards, buttons, form fields, spacing, navigation states and German/English interface copy.

## [1.13.0] - 2026-09-30

### Added
- Host management script with read-only requirement/path checks and explicit automatic-update enable/disable commands, including custom project, backup and Compose paths.
- Checks for service prerequisites, migration status, persistent storage, free space, image override support and interrupted/running updates; management regression tests.

### Changed
- Existing installer delegates to the management script. Disabling the timer preserves running migrations, the image pin, configuration and backups.

### Fixed
- Validate Compose image override support before changing `.env`.
- Check backup capacity even before the configured backup directory exists.

## [1.12.0] - 2026-09-30

### Added
- Opt-in Linux/systemd Docker Compose updater with stable GitHub release detection, digest pinning, a configurable maintenance window, persistent transaction state and exclusive locking.
- Consistent database/uploads backups, storage/space checks, compatible image rollback, failed-release blocking and manual recovery instructions.
- Versioned Prisma migrations and an explicit schema-checked baseline for existing 1.11.0 databases.
- Side-effect-free `/api/ready` endpoint, Docker readiness checks, updater regression checks and disposable database/image backup-restore tests.

### Changed
- Manual `docker compose pull app` / `up` updates remain supported through `latest`, which is promoted only after stable-release verification. Automatic updates remain opt-in and use persistent `SHOOT_IT_IMAGE` digest pinning in `.env`.
- Release CI publishes the updater manifest only after tests, image publication and runtime verification; `main` builds no longer overwrite a stable image tag.
- Docker startup uses the bundled, locked Prisma CLI and `migrate deploy` instead of downloading Prisma and running `db push`.

### Fixed
- Health endpoint version now comes from `package.json`.
- New PostgreSQL 18 installations mount `/var/lib/postgresql` via `.env.example`; existing mount paths stay unchanged until an explicit, backed-up storage migration.
- Docker build context excludes local generated files and uploaded media.

## [1.11.0] - 2026-09-30

### Added
- Admin dashboard with user/project counts, recent users, and registration modes: open, closed, or invitation only.
- Single-use invitation codes with expiry, revocation, and hashed storage; invitation redemption and account creation are atomic.
- Dedicated admin permission, server-side authorization, and explicit grant/revoke commands for existing accounts.
- German and English UI, additive database upgrade script, and registration regression checks.

### Changed
- Signup pages reflect the registration policy; both password and Google OAuth account creation enforce it. Existing accounts can still sign in.

## [1.10.1] - 2026-06-18

### Fixed
- **Guest rating "Not authenticated" error**: Rating an image in a public selection gallery could fail with an authentication error even though guest selection was enabled. The cause was that the rating path (authenticated vs. guest) was chosen based on whether the visitor was logged in, rather than whether they actually had access to the project — so any logged-in user without project access was blocked instead of being treated as a guest. Both the API and the public gallery now decide based on project access: members rate as themselves, everyone else rates as a guest when guest selection is enabled. Logged-in users who lack permission to rate now see a clear "no permission" message instead of a misleading "login to rate" prompt.

## [1.10.0] - 2026-06-01

### Added
- **Direct file download**: Downloads in the public selection and the results view can now be saved directly to a chosen folder as individual files (toggle "Individual files"), recreating the folder structure on disk instead of producing a ZIP. Available in Chromium-based browsers (Chrome/Edge); other browsers automatically use ZIP.

### Fixed
- **Large download stability**: ZIP downloads (selection, results, moodboards) no longer overload the server on big folders. Archives are now streamed without compression (already-compressed photos/videos gained nothing from it) and with proper backpressure, so CPU and memory stay bounded and large downloads complete reliably. Folder structure is preserved.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-06-01

### Added
- **Video Upload & Playback**: Moodboards and Results now support video files (MP4, WebM, MOV) alongside images. Videos play muted as a preview when hovering over them in the gallery and open in the lightbox with full controls and sound on click. A poster frame is generated server-side via ffmpeg, and a duration badge is shown on each video. Works in both the authenticated app and public sharing views (max. 100MB per file).
- **Selection Downloads**: New per-project option ("Allow Downloads" in the Visibility settings) that lets visitors download the public selection images. When enabled, each image gets a download button on hover, images can be marked with checkboxes and downloaded together as a ZIP ("Download selected"), the whole view can be downloaded at once ("Download all"), and single images can be downloaded from the lightbox. Disabled by default; downloads are gated server-side.

### Changed
- **File serving** (`/api/uploads`) now supports HTTP Range requests, enabling video seeking in the player.

## [1.8.7] - 2026-01-21

### Fixed
- **Multiple File Drag & Drop**: Fixed an issue where dragging multiple files into the upload area sometimes only uploaded the first file. This was due to browser data transfer items being cleared prematurely during asynchronous operations; the logic now correctly captures all items synchronously first.

## [1.8.6] - 2026-01-21

### Changed
- **Results View Layout**: The "Results" view (Dashboard & Public) now correctly respects the project's configured Global Gallery Style (Grid, Masonry, Justified), matching the behavior of the Selection view.

## [1.8.5] - 2026-01-21

### Changed
- **Project Settings UI**: Redesigned the Project Form (Edit/Create) to use a Tabbed interface ("Details", "Settings", "Visibility"). This greatly improves usability on mobile devices by reducing scrolling and organizing complex settings logically.

## [1.8.4] - 2026-01-18

### Changed
- **Results View UI**: Completely overhauled the Results View (Dashboard & Public) to match the Selection Gallery consistency. It now features the same sidebar folder navigation, grid layout, and image cards.

### Fixed
- **Drag & Drop**: Improved robustness of the drag and drop area to reliably handle multiple files and folder uploads.
- **Selection Markings**: Restored the colored border markings (ratings) and selection indicators in the gallery view.
- **Filtering Error**: Fixed a server-side exception that occurred when applying star or color filters in the Selection View.
- **Translations**: Added missing translation for `uploadToCurrent`.
- **Public View Consistency**: Fixed layout issues and build errors in the public results view to align with the new sidebar design.

## [1.8.2] - 2026-01-18

### Added
- **Optional Folder Structure**: The hierarchical folder system can now be toggled on/off per project in the settings.

### Changed
- **Public Folder Navigation**: Moved the folder menu from the sidebar to a horizontal pill-based menu above the gallery for a cleaner look.

## [1.8.1] - 2026-01-18

### Added
- **Public Selection Folders**: Hierarchical folder structure is now also visible and navigable on the public selection page.
- **Unassigned Images Filter**: Added an option to view images that are not assigned to any folder in both admin and public views.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-01-18

### Added

- **Selection Folders**:
  - Implemented hierarchical folder structure for selection images.

### Changed

- **Upload Limits**: Increased max upload size for results to 100MB (10x higher than standard moodboard images).
- **Validation**: Updated `validateUpload` utility to support context-specific file size limits.

### Fixed

- **Result Deletion**: Fixed an issue where deleting a folder left abandoned file records in the database and physical files on disk.
  - Changed `ResultFile` and `ResultFolder` relationship to `onDelete: Cascade`.
  - Updated folder deletion API to recursively clean up physical directories for all subfolders and their contents.
